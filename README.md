(Gameplay is much less laggy. gif creation software slows gamplay down significantly)

## About

In this project, I created a 3D tile map within a 2D engine. This included scaling the amount of tiles shown, inserting and deleting tiles, and using some interesting math to determine if the mouse/click is within a certain diamond in the tile map.

## DragonRuby

To create this game, I utilized the game engine DragonRuby. DragonRuby is an incredibly powerful game development engine that provides simplicity without taking away functionality. For more information, pleaes visit the following link:
